ROAD TO RECYCLE APP

This app created by Tejas Ambravan provides information on recycling in the Lake County, Illinois
area in order to reduce recycle contamination and save money on labor and separation.

Data was collected from online sources in conjunction with SWALCO (Solid Waste Agency of Lake County)
and WM (Waste Management)

NOTE: Due to cost reasons, the database has been deactivated. The app functionality will still work
but clicking individual items will not show data.
